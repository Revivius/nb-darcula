# Darcula LAF for NetBeans

A NetBeans Look And Feel plugin using Darcula theme from IntelliJ Idea.

The most recent stable version of this plugin is available at the NetBeans Plugin Portal at http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/62424/darcula-laf-for-netbeans and thus it can be installed from "Tools|Plugins|Available Plugins" from the NetBeans IDE.

Wraps Darcula LAF from:  https://github.com/bulenkov/Darcula and provides required NetBeans specific customizations. **Many thanks to Konstantin Bulenkov for open sourcing original LAF.**

## Change Log

### [1.3] - 2016-01-24
 - Bundled 'Darcula' theme (Tools > Options > Fonts&Colors). Plugin will set theme to Darcula during first restart. Many thanks to **granella** for the theme and helping with packaging it in plugin.
 - It is possible to specify font type and size within IDE via Tools > Options > Appearance > Darcula Look And Feel. Many thanks to **markiewb** for implementing this with other font related issues.
 - More color, border and icon enhancements (including diff, versioning colors and FormDesigner guidelines, new Split Pane UI thanks to hudsonb - https://github.com/bulenkov/Darcula/pull/5)
 - For all addressed issues (13) please see https://github.com/Revivius/nb-darcula/issues?q=milestone%3Av1.3+is%3Aclosed

### [1.2] - 2016-01-19
 - Fixed dark text in Code Completion popup.
 - Removed more harsh white borders (including the ones in Options window and sliding buttons). A few remaining (such as the one in Search Results) are hardcoded and I dont know a good way of patching those.
 - Added a slight margin for buttons

### [1.1] - 2016-01-17
- Font size issue fixed. It is now possible to use --fontsize switch (either in conf file or command line) to specify desired font size, default size is 12.
- 'Darcula for NetBeans' is now in 'Preferred look and feel' drop down as requested (Tools > Options > Appearance > Look and Feel). Plugin will set LAF to Darcula during first restart. After that user can switch LAF without uninstalling/disabling the plugin.
- Colors in Options window match properly with LAF.
- Many harsh white borders (including the one of search box at top right corner of main window) removed.
- Contrasting light versions of most core icons provided (close, slide, minimize, restore etc).
